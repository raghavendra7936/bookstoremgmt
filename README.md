# Book Store Management
Book Store Management using TKinter. This is a mini project created with Python, MySQL & TKinter.
Built a simple search functionality to search a book store and display results. 
Searchable by ISBN, Genre, Author and Title.

This can be extended to build a library software to add new books, issue books, track borrowers and book status.
